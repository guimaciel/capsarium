We will stop becoming “contaminating waste” and become energy for life, even when we are no longer present in the material world, centralizing efforts and research to ensure that values, memories, and the family legacy continue to be preserved, without contamination or degradation of the environment, which over the years has suffered from human actions, contaminating, polluting, and vandalizing for years the sacred places of our memory."

Many concepts were renewed during this period due to the services provided over the years and changes in environmental standards, which began to require sustainability changes.",
    "text2": "For these reasons, in 2012 we began a series of research projects together with universities and renowned research centers, aiming to replace the framework used in funeral urns—the current model of wooden urns, cement/sand and granite graves—with a 100% sealed technological innovation, using and applying socio-environmental public policy, with the objective of proposing an alternative to the use of these materials that degrade nature and do not prevent environmental contamination."
